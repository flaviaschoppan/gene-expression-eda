# Gene Expression Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This repository presents a minimal exploratory inspection of raw gene expression count data.

The objective is to illustrate how basic distributional checks can reveal scale properties and transformation effects prior to any normalization, modeling, or dimensionality reduction.

This project does not perform biological interpretation, statistical inference, or downstream analysis.

The focus is exclusively on inspection of raw data structure and the effect of simple transformations.
