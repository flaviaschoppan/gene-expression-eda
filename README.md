# Gene Expression Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This repository contains a simple exploratory data analysis (EDA) of a small gene expression count matrix.

The goal of this project is to demonstrate how to:
- Load gene expression data
- Inspect basic distributions and summary statistics
- Generate simple diagnostic plots

No normalization, modeling, or dimensionality reduction is performed here.
This project focuses only on **understanding the raw data**.
